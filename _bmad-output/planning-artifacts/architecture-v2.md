## 1. V2 Architecture Delta

### What stays the same

| Component | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| React 19 + TypeScript frontend | Mature, no reason to change |
| Python FastAPI backend | Google Ads SDK is Python, MCP server is Python |
| SQLite via aiosqlite | Zero-config, local-first, sufficient for local scale |
| Claude Code CLI as AI runtime | **Core principle: CLI subscription only, no API** |
| MCP server consumed as-is | 87 tools, no modifications |
| SSE for chat streaming | Simple, proven, HTTP-based |
| Filesystem markdown guidelines | Backward-compatible, editable externally, git-friendly |
| Monorepo (frontend/ + backend/) | Single repo, coordinated deployment |

### What changes

| Component | V1 | V2 | Why |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|
| **Scale model** | 1 user, 1-5 accounts | Multi-account, agency scale (100+ accounts) | Public release for agencies |
| **Database schema** | Single namespace | Per-account partitioning (account_id FK) | Account isolation |
| **Agent intelligence** | Reactive (answer questions) | Proactive (surface issues, goal-aware, phase-aware) | Marketing intelligence |
| **Guidelines** | Manual creation only | Auto-generated + manual editing | Smart onboarding |
| **Data display** | Tables only | Tables + charts + dashboards | Performance visibility |
| **Operations** | Basic (pause, budget, keywords) | Full lifecycle (create campaigns, bulk ops, ad copy) | Editing parity |
| **Conversations** | Single thread, no search | Multi-thread, full-text search, campaign tagging | History management |
| **Frontend** | 3-panel fixed layout | + agency dashboard, + search term manager, + charts | Agency features |
| **Config** | Single .env | Multi-account credentials in encrypted SQLite | Multiple clients |

### What is explicitly NOT changing

| Constraint | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| **No Anthropic API** | Agent runs through Claude Code CLI only. Users pay via CLI subscription, NOT API keys. No `anthropic` SDK import for chat. |
| **No cloud backend** | 100% local. No SaaS, no hosted service, no remote database. |
| **No Docker requirement** | Direct install via `bash install.sh`. No containers. |
| **CLI-first AI** | The Claude Code CLI subprocess model stays. Future Gemini CLI support follows the same pattern (CLI binary, not API). |

### New Dependencies (V2)

| Layer | Technology | Version | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Charts | **Recharts** | 2.x | Performance dashboards, time-series charts |
| Tables (enhanced) | **TanStack Table** | 8.x | Virtual scrolling, bulk selection, advanced filtering |

| Icons | **Lucide React** | Latest | Already in V1, extended for new UI elements |

### What We Are NOT Adding

| Technology | Why Not |
|------------|---------|
| `anthropic` Python SDK | **No API usage.** Agent runs through Claude Code CLI subprocess. |
| `openai` / any API SDK | Same — CLI only. |
| Docker / Docker Compose | Users install directly. No containerization overhead. |
| PostgreSQL / MySQL | SQLite is sufficient for local-first, single-machine use. |
| Redis | No need for distributed cache. SQLite cache is fine. |
| Next.js / SSR framework | Local SPA, no SEO needed. |
| Electron | Runs in browser. No need to bundle a browser. |

## 3. Architectural Decisions

### AD-1: Claude Code CLI as Agent Runtime (REINFORCED)

#### Context

V2 must decide how the AI agent communicates with Claude models. Options:
- (A) Anthropic API directly (`anthropic` SDK) — requires API key, per-token billing
- (B) Claude Code CLI subprocess — uses CLI subscription, no per-token cost
- (C) Claude Code SDK Python package — wraps the CLI, same subscription model

#### Decision

**Stay with Claude Code CLI subprocess** (same as V1). The `claude_code_sdk` Python package wraps the CLI, which is fine. But the critical constraint is: **the agent MUST use the user's Claude Code subscription, NOT an Anthropic API key**.

#### Rationale

- Users already pay for Claude Code subscription ($20/mo Pro, $100/mo Max, $200/mo Team)
- No additional API costs — this is the tool's core economic advantage
- CLI handles authentication, rate limiting, model routing, MCP server management
- Future Gemini CLI support follows the same pattern (CLI binary, not API)
- This is what makes the tool genuinely **free** for users who already have Claude Code

#### Implementation

```python
# backend/app/services/agent.py — V2
# CRITICAL: We spawn the Claude Code CLI process directly.
# We do NOT import or use the `anthropic` SDK for chat.
# The user's Claude Code subscription handles all billing.

import subprocess
import shutil

_NODE_PATH = shutil.which("node") or "node"
_CLI_JS = _find_cli_js()  # Finds Claude Code CLI entry point

async def _run_agent(prompt: str, system_prompt: str, model: str, mcp_config: dict):
    """Spawn Claude Code CLI as subprocess. Uses CLI subscription, not API."""
    cmd = [
        str(_NODE_PATH), str(_CLI_JS),
        "--output-format", "stream-json",
        "--model", model,
        "--max-turns", "15",
        "--verbose",
    ]
    
    # MCP servers configured via --mcp-config
    cmd.extend(["--mcp-config", json.dumps(mcp_config)])
    
    # System prompt via --system-prompt
    cmd.extend(["--system-prompt", system_prompt])
    
    proc = subprocess.Popen(
        cmd,
        stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
        text=True,
    )
    
    # Send user prompt via stdin (avoids shell escaping issues)
    proc.stdin.write(prompt)
    proc.stdin.close()
    
    # Stream JSON responses from stdout
    for line in proc.stdout:
        yield json.loads(line)
```

#### Implications

- No `anthropic` SDK in requirements (for chat)
- Agent startup has ~1-2s latency (CLI process + MCP server init)
- Must handle CLI not found, subscription expired, rate limiting
- Future Gemini CLI support: same subprocess pattern, different binary

#### Future: Gemini CLI Support (Phase 3)

```python
# Same pattern, different CLI binary
if ai_backend == "gemini":
    cmd = [shutil.which("gemini"), "chat", "--stream", ...]
elif ai_backend == "claude":
    cmd = [str(_NODE_PATH), str(_CLI_JS), ...]
```

---

### AD-2: Direct Google Ads SDK for Reads (UNCHANGED)

Same as V1. Use `GoogleAdsSdkClient` for read-only data fetching (campaign browser, metrics, account hierarchy). AI agent reserved for analysis, recommendations, and writes.

**V2 Enhancement:** Direct SDK also used for:
- Smart onboarding scan (bulk account analysis)
- Dashboard aggregation (cross-account metrics)
- Alert detection (CPA spike checks, budget pacing)

---

### AD-3: SSE for Chat Streaming (UNCHANGED)

Same as V1. Server-Sent Events for streaming agent responses to frontend.

---

### AD-4: SQLite with Per-Account Partitioning (ENHANCED)

#### Context

V1 used a single SQLite database with no account isolation. V2 must support 100+ accounts with data isolation.

#### Decision

**Single SQLite database with `account_id` foreign key** on all account-specific tables. NOT separate databases per account.

#### Rationale

- Single file is simpler to manage, backup, migrate
- SQLite handles this scale easily (100 accounts * 1000 campaigns = 100K rows — trivial)
- FTS5 full-text search works across a single database
- Cross-account queries (agency dashboard) are simple JOINs
- Per-account isolation achieved via query filtering, not physical separation

#### Implications

- All queries must include `WHERE account_id = ?` filtering
- Migration script adds `account_id` column to existing V1 tables
- Index on `account_id` for all tables

---

### AD-5: Guidelines Filesystem with Account Namespacing (ENHANCED)

#### Context

V1 stored all guidelines in a flat `data/guidelines/` directory. V2 must support per-account guidelines without name collisions.

#### Decision

**Namespace guidelines by account ID** in the filesystem:

```
data/
├── guidelines/
│   ├── 7178239091/                    # Mercan Group
│   │   ├── BUSINESS_CONTEXT.md
│   │   ├── CAMPAIGN_GUIDELINES.md
│   │   └── MENA_CAMPAIGN_GUIDELINES.md
│   ├── 1234567890/                    # Client B
│   │   ├── BUSINESS_CONTEXT.md
│   │   └── CAMPAIGN_GUIDELINES.md
│   └── _playbooks/                    # Shared playbook templates
│       ├── lead-gen-professional.md
│       └── ecommerce-shopping.md
```

#### Rationale

- Clear separation per account
- Files still editable externally, git-friendly
- Backward compatible: V1 migration moves existing files into first account's folder
- Playbooks are global (shared across accounts)

#### Migration from V1

```python
# On first V2 startup, if flat guidelines exist:
# 1. Detect existing files in data/guidelines/
# 2. Move them into data/guidelines/{default_account_id}/
# 3. Log the migration
```

---

### AD-6: Marketing Intelligence as a Service Layer (NEW)

#### Context

V2 needs campaign goal detection, phase awareness, proactive recommendations, and cross-campaign reasoning. Where does this logic live?

#### Decision

New **`MarketingIntelligenceService`** that sits between the data layer and the agent service. It analyzes campaign data and enriches the agent's system prompt with marketing context.

#### Rationale

- Separates marketing logic from agent orchestration
- Can be tested independently (input: campaign data → output: intelligence report)
- Enriches both the agent's prompt AND the dashboard UI
- Runs on direct SDK data (fast), not through the AI agent (expensive)

#### Implementation

```python
# backend/app/services/marketing_intelligence.py

class MarketingIntelligenceService:
    """Analyzes campaign data to produce marketing intelligence."""
    
    async def detect_campaign_phase(self, campaign_data: dict) -> CampaignPhase:
        """Detect launch/learning/optimization/scaling/sunset from data signals."""
        age_days = (date.today() - campaign_data["start_date"]).days
        conversions_30d = campaign_data["conversions_30d"]
        bid_strategy_changed = campaign_data.get("bid_strategy_change_date")
        
        if age_days < 14:
            return CampaignPhase.LAUNCH
        if bid_strategy_changed and (date.today() - bid_strategy_changed).days < 14:
            return CampaignPhase.LEARNING
        if conversions_30d > 30 and campaign_data["cpa"] < campaign_data.get("target_cpa", float("inf")):
            return CampaignPhase.SCALING
        # ... more heuristics
    
    async def detect_campaign_goal(self, campaign_data: dict) -> CampaignGoal:
        """Infer goal from conversion actions and bid strategy."""
        conversion_actions = campaign_data["conversion_actions"]

            return CampaignGoal.ECOMMERCE
        if any("lead" in c["name"].lower() or "form" in c["name"].lower() for c in conversion_actions):
            return CampaignGoal.LEAD_GEN
        if bid_strategy == "MAXIMIZE_CLICKS":
            return CampaignGoal.TRAFFIC
        return CampaignGoal.UNKNOWN
    
    async def generate_proactive_insights(self, account_id: str) -> list[Insight]:
        """Surface issues and opportunities without being asked."""
        insights = []
        campaigns = await self._get_campaign_data(account_id)
        
        for campaign in campaigns:
            # CPA spike detection

            days_in_month = 30
            day_of_month = date.today().day
            expected_spend_pct = day_of_month / days_in_month
            actual_spend_pct = campaign["cost_mtd"] / campaign["monthly_budget"]
            if actual_spend_pct > expected_spend_pct * 1.2:
                insights.append(Insight(
                    type="budget_pacing",

                ))
            
            # Search term review cadence
            last_review = campaign.get("last_search_term_review")
            if last_review and (date.today() - last_review).days > 7:

- Conversion volume: {campaign['conversions_7d']} (7d), {campaign['conversions_30d']} (30d)
"""
```

---

### AD-7: Multi-Account Credential Management (NEW)

#### Context

V1 used a single `.env` file for one set of credentials. V2 must support multiple Google Ads accounts, each potentially with different credentials (different MCC accounts for different agency clients).

#### Decision

**Store credentials in encrypted SQLite** with the account record. Keep `.env` as the initial/default credential source for backward compatibility.

#### Implementation

```python
# backend/app/services/credentials.py
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import os

class CredentialStore:
    """Encrypted credential storage in SQLite."""
    
    def __init__(self, encryption_key: bytes = None):
        # Key derived from machine-specific source or user-provided passphrase
        self.fernet = Fernet(encryption_key or self._derive_key())
    
    def _derive_key(self) -> bytes:
        """Derive encryption key from machine ID + app secret."""
        # Use a stable machine identifier + fixed salt
        import hashlib, base64
        machine_id = str(uuid.getnode())  # MAC address as stable ID
        key = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256', machine_id.encode(), b'google-ads-agent', 100000)
        return base64.urlsafe_b64encode(key)
    
    async def store_credentials(self, account_id: str, credentials: dict):
        encrypted = self.fernet.encrypt(json.dumps(credentials).encode())
        await db.execute(
            "INSERT OR REPLACE INTO account_credentials (account_id, credentials_encrypted) VALUES (?, ?)",
            (account_id, encrypted)
        )
    
    async def get_credentials(self, account_id: str) -> dict:
        row = await db.fetchone(
            "SELECT credentials_encrypted FROM account_credentials WHERE account_id = ?",
            (account_id,)
        )
        return json.loads(self.fernet.decrypt(row[0]))
```

#### Migration from V1

On first V2 startup:
1. Read existing `backend/.env` credentials
2. Create default account record in SQLite
3. Encrypt and store credentials in `account_credentials` table
4. `.env` file kept for backward compatibility (still loaded if DB has no credentials)

---

### AD-8: Smart Onboarding via Direct SDK (NEW)

#### Context

When a new account is connected, V2 should auto-analyze campaigns and generate initial guidelines. This could go through the AI agent (expensive, slow) or direct SDK (fast, free).

#### Decision

Use **direct Google Ads SDK** for the onboarding scan. Generate guidelines using **deterministic logic** (not AI), then optionally refine with AI agent.

#### Rationale

- SDK scan is fast (~5-10s for full account) and costs nothing
- Guidelines generation from structured data doesn't need AI creativity
- AI agent can be used afterward to refine (optional, user-initiated)
- Keeps onboarding working even if Claude Code CLI is not installed yet

#### Implementation

```python
# backend/app/services/onboarding.py

class OnboardingService:
    """Auto-analyze new accounts and generate initial guidelines."""
    
    async def scan_account(self, account_id: str) -> AccountScan:
        """Full account scan using direct SDK."""
        ads_service = GoogleAdsService(account_id)
        
        scan = AccountScan(account_id=account_id)
        scan.campaigns = await ads_service.get_campaigns(account_id)
        
        for campaign in scan.campaigns:
            campaign.ad_groups = await ads_service.get_adgroups(account_id, campaign.id)
            campaign.conversion_actions = await ads_service.get_conversion_actions(account_id)
            campaign.phase = await marketing_intel.detect_campaign_phase(campaign)
            campaign.goal = await marketing_intel.detect_campaign_goal(campaign)
        
        return scan
    
    async def generate_guidelines(self, scan: AccountScan) -> dict[str, str]:
        """Generate markdown guidelines from scan data. No AI needed."""
        files = {}
        
        # Business context
        files["BUSINESS_CONTEXT.md"] = self._generate_business_context(scan)
        
        # Campaign guidelines
        files["CAMPAIGN_GUIDELINES.md"] = self._generate_campaign_guidelines(scan)
        
        return files
    
    def _generate_business_context(self, scan: AccountScan) -> str:
        return f"""# Business Context

# V2: GET /api/accounts/{account_id}/hierarchy

# V1: GET /api/accounts/{id}/campaigns
# V2: GET /api/accounts/{account_id}/campaigns (same)

# V1: POST /api/conversations
# V2: POST /api/conversations (body now requires account_id)

# V1: GET /api/guidelines

## 9. AI Agent Architecture

### System Prompt Structure (V2)

The agent's system prompt is now 6 layers (up from 5 in V1):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐

### Layer 0: Marketing Intelligence Prompt

```
## Marketing Intelligence

**Campaign:** Portugal Golden Visa (23636342079)
**Objective:** Lead Generation (form submissions)
**Phase:** Optimization (stable data, 45 conversions in last 30 days)

### Phase Rules
- ✅ Safe to adjust bids and budgets
- ✅ Safe to add/remove keywords
- ✅ Safe to test new ad copy
- ⚠️ Bid strategy changes: proceed with caution (would reset learning)

### Active Alerts
- ⚠️ CPA spiked 35% this week ($18.50 vs $13.70 trailing avg)
  → Recommended: Review search terms for new irrelevant matches
- ℹ️ Search terms not reviewed in 9 days
  → Recommended: Run search term audit

### Account Context
- 3 active campaigns in this account
- Monthly spend: $8,400 across all campaigns
- Account-level goal: Maximize qualified leads for Golden Visa programs
- No budget conflicts detected between campaigns
```

### Confirmation Tiers

```python
# backend/app/services/agent.py

CONFIRMATION_TIERS = {
    # HIGH IMPACT: Always confirm
    "high": [
        "campaign_budget_update",      # Budget change > 20%
        "campaign_status_update",      # Pausing active campaign
        "bid_strategy_update",         # Changing bid strategy
        "campaign_create",             # Creating new campaign
        "campaign_delete",             # Removing campaign
    ],
    
    # MEDIUM IMPACT: Confirm by default, can be auto-approved
    "medium": [
        "keyword_add",                 # Adding keywords
        "keyword_status_update",       # Pausing keywords
        "ad_create",                   # Creating new ads
        "ad_update",                   # Editing ad copy
        "targeting_update",            # Location/language changes
    ],
    
    # LOW IMPACT: Auto-execute, notify user
    "low": [
        "negative_keyword_add",        # Adding negatives
        "search_term_exclude",         # Excluding search terms
        "guideline_update",            # Updating guidelines
        "label_add",                   # Adding labels
    ],
}
```

### Future: Gemini CLI Integration (Phase 3)

```python
# backend/app/services/agent.py — Future abstraction

class AIBackend:
    """Abstract interface for AI CLI backends."""
    
    async def stream(self, prompt: str, system_prompt: str, 
                     mcp_config: dict) -> AsyncIterator[AgentEvent]:
        raise NotImplementedError

class ClaudeCodeBackend(AIBackend):
    """Claude Code CLI subprocess backend."""
    
    async def stream(self, prompt, system_prompt, mcp_config):
        cmd = [str(_NODE_PATH), str(_CLI_JS), 
               "--output-format", "stream-json", ...]
        # ... existing implementation

class GeminiCLIBackend(AIBackend):
    """Gemini CLI subprocess backend (Phase 3)."""
    
    async def stream(self, prompt, system_prompt, mcp_config):
        cmd = [shutil.which("gemini"), "chat", "--stream", ...]
        # ... future implementation

def get_ai_backend(backend_name: str = "claude") -> AIBackend:
    backends = {
        "claude": ClaudeCodeBackend,
        "gemini": GeminiCLIBackend,
    }
    return backends[backend_name]()
```

## 10. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Error Handling Hierarchy

```
User-facing errors (frontend toast/banner)
    ↑
API error responses (FastAPI exception handlers)
    ↑
Service-level exceptions
    ├─ GoogleAdsError (API quota, auth, invalid request)
    ├─ AgentError (CLI not found, subscription expired, timeout)
    ├─ CredentialError (encryption failure, missing credentials)
    ├─ OnboardingError (account scan failed, no campaigns)
    └─ GuidelineError (file not found, parse error)
```

### Caching Strategy (V2)

```python
# Cache keys now include account_id
CACHE_KEYS = {
    "campaigns": "{account_id}:campaigns",
    "campaign_detail": "{account_id}:{campaign_id}:detail",
    "keywords": "{account_id}:{campaign_id}:keywords",
    "search_terms": "{account_id}:{campaign_id}:search_terms",
    "account_health": "{account_id}:health",
    "dashboard": "dashboard:all",
}

# Different TTLs for different data types
CACHE_TTLS = {
    "campaigns": 300,        # 5 minutes (same as V1)
    "campaign_detail": 300,   # 5 minutes
    "keywords": 300,          # 5 minutes
    "search_terms": 3600,     # 1 hour (expensive query)
    "account_health": 600,    # 10 minutes
    "dashboard": 600,         # 10 minutes
}
```

### Security Model

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Security Boundary: localhost only        │
│                                         │
│  Credentials:                           │
│  ├─ Encrypted in SQLite (Fernet)       │
│  ├─ .env file as fallback (V1 compat)  │
│  └─ Never logged, never in chat history │
│                                         │
│  Data isolation:                        │
│  ├─ Per-account in SQLite (FK)         │
│  ├─ Per-account on filesystem          │
│  └─ No cross-account data leakage      │
│                                         │
│  AI agent:                              │

### Performance Budget

| Operation | V1 | V2 Target | Strategy |
|-----------|-----|-----------|----------|
| App load | ~2s | < 2s | Code splitting, lazy routes |
| Account switch | N/A | < 1s | Pre-fetch account data on hover |
| Campaign list (1000 items) | N/A | < 500ms | Virtual scrolling (TanStack Table) |
| Dashboard (10 accounts) | N/A | < 3s | Parallel account queries, cached |
| Chart render | N/A | < 500ms | Recharts with memoization |
| Full-text search | N/A | < 200ms | SQLite FTS5 index |
| Smart onboarding | N/A | < 60s | Parallel campaign scans |
